# LAC SummerGames 2025
The LAC SummerGames 2025 were launched as follow-up to the successful LAC Summer Games 24 to encourage professionals and particularly students in the art of designing and deploying lidar data processing algorithms and lidar-assisted controllers. Participants will be given the opportunity to increase their knowledge in LAC and by that, the SummerGames will trigger creativity and motivate the development of new concepts.

All the necessary information regarding the three different disciplines and the general timeline can be found in the official document: (to be uploaded).

The best way to get started would be to familiarize yourself with the code of the given examples and reproduce the results presented in the official document.
